Algorithm Trading
==================================
Nowadays, each individual has a particular philosophy of living, the philosophy that one believes in, which gives a  different living value everyone would love to have and different objectives to achieve. Similar logics in trading, all investors have their own thoughts and views.

In the markets, all their action by their thoughts, different investment strategies are designed with an investment philosophy behind it which is capable to fill different sort of investors's thought. Whether in global or Chinese economy, uncertainties for any investment strategies to handle on are actually the prediction for peoples' next action/movement. This is done by many different method of technical and statically analysis.

In this project, I designed my own trading strategy according to RSI and RSI2 trading strategies advocate by J.Welles Wilder and Larry Connors respectively, and made some adjustment such as setting volume of long/short according to market condition and the value of RSI/RSI2. A simulative trading system is established with python and historical datum through api provided by Sohu are used for verification of my trading strategy. Considering it a testing trading system, commission charge and closing trasanction havn't been taken into account.

I realize that there were so many factors influencing the stock market, so my trading strategy won't have much reference value in actual trading, please don't pay much attention on this non-techinical project.

I would add more trading strategies in the future, as metioned above, don't pay much attention on it.
